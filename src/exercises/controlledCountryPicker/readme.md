Acceptance Criteria:

Use the COUNTRIES constant to dynamically generate the set of <option> elements.
In order to map over an object, you'll need to use something like Object.keys() or Object.entries()
There should be a "blank" option, selected by default. It shouldn't default to the first country in the list.
The indicator at the bottom should update when the user changes their selected country.
No warnings in the dev console
